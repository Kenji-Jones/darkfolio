The goal for this project was to build a station wagon that was less than 2000lbs (most cars are 3000lbs -4000lbs and sometimes more), rear wheel drive ( more exciting to drive), manual transmission, and a good sounding engine with a lot of torque. Through the constraints of budget, aesthetics, and what I had access to, I settled on building a 1981 Toyota Corolla Wagon (TE72) with an all aluminum 32 valve V8 from a Lexus SC400.
